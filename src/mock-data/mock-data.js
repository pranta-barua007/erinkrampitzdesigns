      data: "I’m not sure where to even begin with this testimonial so I will keep it simple. Erin has a unique talent to transform your home into a special place. Your home will become the relaxing, cozy, organized space that you’ve always imagined. Her work will change the way you see and feel about your home in the most positive way. It will become the place you retreat to after a long, busy day. And most importantly a place for you and your family to gather comfortably. Erin has impeccable attention to detail. She will make the home “your’s” by using so much of what you already have! In fact, she only purchased a handful of small items as finishing touches for our home. Erin’s blend of talent and passion for what she does is evident in her work. She goes above and beyond to make dreams come true! She listens to your wishes and then delivers beyond what you could ever imagine!",

      data: "From the moment Erin stepped foot into our house we knew she was perfect for us! After 7 years of living in a house full of baby gear, toys and honestly too much stuff it was time for a makeover! She put together an awesome design plan and stepped into action. From coordinating contractors to decorating nearly our entire house we were done in about 6 weeks. She does not mess around and waste her time or your money. My skeptical husband is extremely happy with how everything turned out. The kids love how the house looks and even try to help keep the house clean now! The attention to detail is unbeaten and we are still discovering new things throughout the house that fit our family perfectly. Words cannot express our gratitude to Erin for putting so much love into making our house a beautiful home.",

      data: "​I’ve thought about writing this review for days, but I’m hesitant only because I do not think I can put her talent into words. I cannot begin to express how talented Erin is…… this chick is amazing! She is like a real life Mary Poppins- she’s flies in with her magical bag of tape measures and pliers and mirror hanging wire (who knows what else is in there), and things just start happening!!!! From her rapid pace to her attention to detail, she is just amazing to work with. When she first did a consultation, I was assuming I’d need to redo everything and spend tons of money. Although I bought minimal items to help with our home makeover that she suggested, most items were already in my house! Things that I thought needed to be tossed or hadn’t used or seen in years, she was able to repurpose and make stunning! She was able to revitalize my house and truly make it a home with a cozy feel. My family has enjoyed her transformation of our spaces. She truly can make your house a home. If you think your home needs a fresh look, if you have a budget, if you think my house could never look like that, you are wrong. Erin can make your vision come to life. From paint to plants from indoor to outdoor, her eye for placement and colors cannot be beat! My family and I cannot thank her enough for the refreshed look of our home.",

I can’t begin to say how happy and satisfied we were with the outcome. We basically gave her free reign to do her thing – and she came through with flying colors! I look forward to working with her again on other projects we are planning to do. Her ability to basically read my mind and transform that into the finished product was beyond amazing! ( and I am sure that wasn’t very easy, lol) She even added one of her own paintings to our dining area, and I could not have been more blown away! It was the perfect touch! My husband even said: She knocked it out of the park — HOMERUN! And he is not easy to please — LOLThanks again Erin! We truly appreciate your hard work and dedication you put into this project – I would recommend you to anyone that needs a change or new beginning to put their home in your hands and let you do your magic!",

She went above and beyond, literally did everything I wanted and needed to be done without me having to ask or say. Great detail and perfection were put into her work and it truly shows throughout my house. She even organized my freaking junk room which would have taken me a couple months!! Erin is amazing, I can’t think of anyone who would be able to come close to the hard work and talent she brings to the table.",

      data: "First, I would like to thank God for allowing me to meet Erin and her amazing family. The first day I contact Erin for consulting she was full of energy and we just were discussing my vision and she asked for a video of my home and I sent it to her and within 10 minutes she said, ” let me see if I can come by today.” I stay in Conroe which is a hour and some minutes from her location but she was still excited and full of energy! She arrived and she moved things around during his consulting time and took a ton of pictures. Next thing I know two hours past and she was sending me a text stating she would do the job on the first of March and let’s get the ball going yay! Little did she know that we have the same type of attitude about when we want something we want it now and her and her amazing husband killed the job! They went above and beyond my expectations I will be using her for some remodeling and organizing as well, I love you Erin and you are a beast at what you do! Also, thanks for making my son want to sleep in his room without a fight!",
